# FlightSimulator
Second year project - Milestone 1
Preview
A flight simulator desktop application that interacts with a dedicated server. We built our multithread application using C# and WPF with the MVVM software architectural pattern. The program features a convenient user interface for operating a small aircraft. The GUI contains four main components: A map components, a dashboard, a joystick and a connection section.

The user can connect to a server using the connect section, and fly the plane using the joystick. The plane moves on the map according to the data received from the server. The dashboard data is also displayed according to the data received from the server.
